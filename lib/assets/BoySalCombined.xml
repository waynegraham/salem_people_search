					<p>What say you, are you guilty of witchcraft, of which you are <orig
							reg="suspected">sus- <lb/> pected </orig>, or not? No Sir, I say before
						God, before whom I stand, that <lb/> I know nothing of witchcraft. Who is
						this man? <name type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name> named <lb/>
						him. -- <name type="person" key="walmar">Mary Walcot</name> said she had
						seen his shape. What do you say to <lb/> this? I never did hurt them. Who
						hurt you <name type="person" key="puann2">Ann Putman</name> ? That man.
						<lb/> I never hurt her. <name type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name>
						said, he is upon the beam. Just such a <lb/> discovery of the person carried
						out, and she confessed; and if you <lb/> would find mercy of God, you must
						confess. -- If I should confess <lb/> this, I must confess what is false.
						Tell how far you have gone, who <lb/> hurts you? I do not know, I am
						absolutely free. As you say, God <lb/> knows. If you will confess the truth,
						we desire nothing else that you <lb/> may not hide you guilt, if you are
						guilty, and therefore confess if so. <lb/> I speak before God that I am
						clear from this accusation. What, in all <lb/> respects? Yes in all
						respects. Doth this man hurt you? Their mouths <lb/> were stopped. You hear
						several accuse you, though one cannot open <lb/> her mouth. I am altogether
						free. Charge him not unless it be he. This <lb/> is the man say some, and
						some say he is very like him. How did you <lb/> know his name? He did not
						tell me himself, but other witches told <lb/> me. Ann Putman said, it is the
						same man, and then she was taken with <lb/> a fit. <name type="person"
							key="walmar">Mary Walcot</name> , is this the man? He is like him, I
						cannot say it is <lb/> he. <name type="person" key="lewmer">Mercy

						a bunch on his eyes. <name type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman</name> ,
						in a fit, said, be you the man? ay, <lb/> do you say you be the man? did you
						put a mist before my eyes? <lb/> Then he was sent forth till several others
						were examined. When he was <lb/> brought in again, by reason of much people,
						and many in the <orig reg="windows">win- <lb/> dows </orig> so that the
						accusers could not have a clear view of him, he was <lb/>
						<pb n="50"/> ordered to be abroad, and the accusers to go forth to him and

							<orig reg="magistrates">magis- <lb/> trates </orig> and many others
						discoursed quietly with him, one and all <lb/> acquitting him, but yet said
						he was like that man, but he had not the <lb/> wen they saw in his
						apparition, Note, he was a hilly faced man and <lb/> stood shaded by reason
						of his own hair, so that for a time he seemed <lb/> to some by-standers and

						Accusation of a <lb/> company of poor distracted, or possessed Creatures or
						Witches; <lb/> and being sent by <name type="person" key="stough">Mr.
							Stoughton</name> , arrived there the <date value="1692-05-31"
							certainty="confirmed">31st of May</date>, <lb/> and appeared at
						Salem-Village, before <name type="person" key="gidbar">Mr. Gidney</name> ,
							<name type="person" key="hawjoh">Mr. Hathorn,</name>
						<lb/> and <name type="person" key="corjoh">Mr. Curwin.</name>
					</p>
					<p>Those Wenches being present, who plaid their jugling tricks, <lb/> falling
						down, crying out, and staring in Peoples Faces; the <orig reg="Magistrates"
							>Magi- <lb/> strates </orig> demanded of them several times, who it was
						of all the People <lb/> in the Room that hurt them? one of these Accusers
						pointed several <lb/> times at one <name type="person" key="hilzeb">Captain
							Hill</name> , there present, but spake nothing; the <lb/> same Accuser
						had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he <lb/> stooped down to her
						Ear, then she cried out, <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> ,
							<name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> afflicted <lb/> her; one
						of the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen <name type="person"
							key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> , <lb/> she answered no, he asked her how she
						knew it was <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> ? She <lb/> said,
						the Man told her so. </p>
					<p>Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring <lb/> was
						made; and the same Accuser cried out, &ldquo;there stands <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> , a <lb/> bold fellow with his
						Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and <lb/> Shot to the Indians and
						French, and lies with the Indian Squaes, <lb/> and has Indian
						Papooses.&rdquo; Then was <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name>
						committed to the Marshal's <lb/> Custody, and his Sword taken from him; for
						they said he afflicted <lb/> them with his Sword. After some hours <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> was sent for to the <lb/>
						Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required <lb/>
						<name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> to stand upon a Chair, to the
						open view of all the People. </p>

					<pb n="53"/>

					<p>The Accusers cried out that <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> did
						pinch them, then, when <lb/> he stood upon the Chair, in the sight of all
						the People, a good way <lb/> distant from them, one of the Magistrates bid
						the Marshal to hold <lb/> open <name type="person" key="aldjoh"
							>Aldin's</name> hands, that he might not pinch those Creatures. <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name>
						<lb/> asked them why they should think that he should come to that <lb/>
						Village to afflict those persons that he never knew or saw before? <lb/>
						<name type="person" key="gidbar">Mr. Gidney</name> bid <name type="person"
							key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> confess, and give glory to God; <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> said <lb/> he hoped he should
						give glory to God, and hoped he should never <lb/> gratifie the Devil; but
						appealed to all that ever knew him, if they <lb/> ever suspected him to be
						such a person, and challenged any one, <lb/> that could bring in any thing
						upon their own knowledge, that might <lb/> give suspicion of his being such
						an one. <name type="person" key="gidbar"> Mr. Gidney</name> said he had
						<lb/> known <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> many Years, and
						had been at Sea with him, and <orig reg="always">al- <lb/> ways </orig>
						look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did see cause <lb/> to alter
						his judgment: <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> answered, he was
						sorry for that, but <lb/> he hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he
						would recall <lb/> that judgment again, and added that he hoped that he
						should with <lb/> Job maintain his Integrity till he died. They bid <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> look upon <lb/> the Accusers,
						which he did, and then they fell down. <name type="person" key="aldjoh"
							>Aldin</name> asked <lb/>
						<name type="person" key="gidbar">Mr. Gidney</name> , what Reason there could
						be given, why <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin's</name> looking <lb/>
						upon <hi rend="italics">him </hi> did not strike <hi rend="italics">him
						</hi> down as well; but no reason was given <lb/> that I heard. But the
						Accusers were brought to <name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> to
						touch them, <lb/> and this touch they said made them well. <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> began to speak of <lb/> the
						Providence of God in suffering these Creatures to accuse <orig
							reg="Innocent">Inno- <lb/> cent </orig> persons. <name type="person"
							key="noynic">Mr. Noyes</name> asked <name type="person" key="aldjoh"
							>Aldin</name> why he would offer to speak of <lb/> the Providence of
						God. God by his Providence (said <name type="person" key="noynic">Mr.

						went on with <orig reg="Discourse">Dis- <lb/> course </orig>, and stopt
							<name type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin's</name> mouth, as to that. <name
							type="person" key="aldjoh">Aldin</name> told <name type="person"

						</orig> the said <name type="person" key="bisbri">Bishop</name> did
						entertaine people in her house at <orig reg="unseasonable">unseason- <lb/>

						&amp; had reprooved the said <name type="person" key="bisbri">Bishop</name>
						for promoting such disorders, But <orig reg="received">re- <lb/> ceived

					<p>I gave s'd <name type="person" key="trasar">Christian Trask</name> direction

							key="bisbri">Edw. Bishop's</name> house would have been a house of <lb/>

					<p>But as to <name type="person" key="trasar">Christian Trask</name> the next

						<lb/> [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came
						<lb/> from] my house when shee complained against <name type="person"

					<pb n="96"/>

					<p>She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by <lb/> fasting
						&amp; prayer &amp; the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd <name

						<lb/> to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her]

							>fitts</orig> of those bewitched at <lb/> Salem Village I call to mind
						some of hers to be much like some of <lb/> theirs. </p>
					<p>The said <name type="person" key="trasar">Trask</name> when recovered as I
						understood it did manifest <lb/> strong suspicion that shee had been
						bewitched by the s'd <name type="person" key="bisedw2">Bishop's</name>
						<lb/> wife &amp; showed so much aversness from having any conversation that
						<lb/> I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd <name type="person"

						[was] <lb/> agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the forenoon at the
							<orig reg="publ">pub- <lb/> l </orig>[i]ck meeting to o'r public
						desturbance &amp; so continued sometimes <lb/> better sometimes worse unto
						her death, manifesting that shee under <lb/> temptation to kill her selfe or
						somebody else. </p>
					<p>I enquired of <name type="person" key="rinmar">Marg'rt Ring</name> who kept
						at or nigh the house, what <lb/> shee had observed of s'd <name
							type="person" key="trasar">Trask</name> before this last distraction

						was much given to reading &amp; search the <orig reg="prophecys">pro- <lb/>
							phecys </orig> of scrip[ture]. </p>
					<p>The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house <lb/> she[e]
						came home &amp; said shee had been w'th <name type="person" key="bisbri"
							>Goody Bishop</name> &amp; that <lb/> they two were now friend or to
						that effect. </p>
					<p>I was oft praying w'th &amp; councelling of <name type="person" key="trasar"
							>Goody Trask</name> before her <lb/> death and not many days before her
						end being there shee seemed <lb/> more rationall &amp; earnestly desired
							<name type="person" key="bisedw2">Edw: Bishop</name> might be sent for
						<lb/> that shee might make friends with him, I asked her if shee had <lb/>
						wronged <name type="person" key="bisedw2">Edw. Bishop</name> shee said not
						that shee knew of unless it were <lb/> in taking his shovel-board pieces
						when people were at play w'th them <lb/> &amp; throwing them into the fyre
						&amp; if she did <orig reg="evil">evill</orig> in it she was very <lb/>
						sorry for it &amp; desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her.
						<lb/> this was the very day before she dyed, or a few days before. </p>
					<p>Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in <lb/> those
						intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly desired prayers <lb/>
						&amp; the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on her <lb/>
						behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe &amp; I judge was
						<lb/> her owne hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand. </p>
					<p>As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice <lb/> of her
						wind pipe cutt out. &amp; another wound above that threww the <lb/>
						<pb n="97"/> windpipe &amp; Gullet &amp; the veine they call jugular. So

						<lb/> A. A black dog. Q. Did the dog ever come to you? A. No. Q. But <lb/>
						you said you saw a cat once. What did that say to you? A. It said <lb/> it

						said her mother baptized her, and the devil or black man was <lb/> not
						there, as she saw, and her mother said when she baptized her, <lb/> thou are

						pinched them, and she said she had no puppets, but <lb/> she went to them
						that she afflicted. Being asked whether she went in <lb/> her body or her
						spirit, she said in her spirit. She said her mother <lb/> carried her
						thither to afflict. Q. How did your mother carry you <lb/> when she was in
						prison? A. She came like a black cat. Q. How did <lb/> you know that it was
						your mother? A. The cat told me so that she <lb/> was my mother. She said

					<head>( <name type="person" key="carnat">Nathaniel Cary's</name> Account of his

					<p>I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused of <orig reg="Witchcraft"
							>Witch- <lb/> craft </orig>, being much disturbed at it, by advice, we
						went to <orig reg="Salem-Village">Salem- <lb/> Village </orig>, to see if
						the afflicted did know her; we arrived there, 24 May, it happened to be a
						day appointed for Examination; <orig reg="accordingly">accord- <lb/> ingly
						</orig> soon after our arrival, <name type="person" key="hawjoh">Mr.
							Hathorn</name> and <name type="person" key="corjoh">Mr. Curwin</name> ,
						etc., went <lb/> to the Meeting-house, which was the place appointed for
						that Work, <lb/> the Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care to
						get a <lb/> convenient place, I observed, that the afflicted were two Girls
						of <lb/> about Ten Years old, and about two or three other, of about <orig
							reg="eighteen">eight- <lb/> een </orig>, one of the Girls talked most,
						and could discern more than the <lb/> rest. The Prisoners were called in one
						by one, and as they came in <lb/> were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was
						placed about 7 or 8 foot <lb/> from the Justices, and the Accusers between
						the Justices and them; <lb/> the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before
						the Justices, with an <lb/>
						<pb n="208"/> Officer appointed to hold each hand, least they should
						therewith <lb/> afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be constantly on
						the <orig reg="Justices">Jus- <lb/> tices </orig>; for if they look'd on the
						afflicted, they would either fall into <lb/> their Fits, or cry out of being
						hurt by them; after Examination of <lb/> the Prisoners, who it was afflicted
						these Girls, etc., they were put <lb/> upon saying the Lords Prayer, as a
						tryal of their guilt; after the <lb/> afflicted seem'd to be out of their
						Fits, they would look steadfastly <lb/> on some one person, and frequently
						not speak; and then the Justices <lb/> said they were struck dumb, and after
						a little time would speak again; <lb/> then the Justices said to the
						Accusers, &ldquo;which of you will go and <lb/> touch the Prisoner at the
						Bar?&rdquo; then the most couragious would <orig reg="adventure">ad- <lb/>
							venture </orig>, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily
						fall <lb/> down as in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken
						up <lb/> and carried to the Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon
						<lb/> as they were touched by the accused, the Justices would say, they are
						<lb/> well, before I could discern any alteration; by which I observed that
						<lb/> the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus far I was only as <lb/>
						a Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but no notice <lb/>
						taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her <lb/>
						and asked her name. </p>
					<p>But I having an opportunity to Discourse <name type="person" key="haljoh">Mr.
							Hale</name> (with whom <lb/> I had formerly acquaintance) I took his
						advice, what I had best to <lb/> do, and desired of him that I might have an
						opportunity to speak <lb/> with her that accused my Wife; which he promised
						should be, I <lb/> acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him. </p>
					<p>Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over, <lb/> and told me I
						had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser, <lb/>
						<hi rend="italics">viz </hi>. <name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail
							Williams</name> , a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old; but that we could <lb/>
						not be in private at <name type="person" key="parsam">Mr. Parris's</name>
						House, as he had promised me; we <lb/> went therefore into the Alehouse,
						where an Indian Man attended us, <lb/> who it seems was one of the
						afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, <lb/> he shewed several Scars, that
						seemed as if they had been long there, <lb/> and shewed them as done by
						Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his <lb/> Wife, who also was a Slave, was
						imprison'd for Witchcraft. And now <lb/> instead of one Accuser, they all
						came in, who began to tumble down <lb/> like Swine, and then three Women
						were called in to attend them. <lb/> We in the Room were all at a stand, to
						see who they would cry <lb/> out of; but in a short time they cried out,
							<name type="person" key="careli2">Cary</name> ; and immediately <lb/>
						<pb n="209"/> after a Warrant was sent from the Justices to bring my Wife
						before <lb/> them, who were sitting in a Chamber near by, waiting for this. </p>
					<p>Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two <lb/> Girls;
						my Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any <orig
							reg="knowledge">knowl- <lb/> edge </orig> of them before that day; she
						was forced to stand with her <lb/> Arms stretched out. I did request that I
						might hold one of her <lb/> hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me
						to wipe the Tears <lb/> from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I
						did; then she <lb/> desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she
						should faint. </p>
					<p>Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment <lb/> those
						persons, and she should have strength enough to stand. I <lb/> speaking
						something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded <lb/> me to be
						silent, or else I should be turned out of the Room. The <lb/> Indian before
						mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her <lb/> Accusers: being come
						in, he now (when before the Justices) fell <lb/> down and tumbled about like
						a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices <lb/> asked the Girls, who afflicted
						the Indian? they answered she ( <orig reg="meaning">mean- <lb/> ing </orig>
						my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices ordered her to touch <lb/> him,
						in order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way, <lb/> least
						instead of curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on <lb/> him,
						her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took <lb/> hold on
						her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous <lb/> manner;
						then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and <lb/> the cure was
						quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their <lb/> Inhumane
						dealings, uttered a hasty Speech (That God would take <lb/> vengeance on
						them, and desired that God would deliver us out of the <lb/> hands of
						unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with <lb/> difficulty and
						charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it; <lb/> if there had,
						could have taken but little rest that Night. She was <lb/> committed to
						Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to <lb/> remove her to
						Cambridge Prison, which is in our County of <orig reg="Middlesex">Middle-
							<lb/> sex </orig>. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor
						put <lb/> Irons on her legs (having received such a command) the weight of
						<lb/> them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions,
						<lb/> soon brought her into Convulsion Fits, so that I thought she would
						<lb/> have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken
						<lb/> off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her Life,
						<lb/> so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem <lb/>
						<pb n="210"/> coming on, I went thither, to see how things were there
						managed; <lb/> and finding that the <orig reg="Specter"
						>Spectre</orig>-Evidence was there received, together <lb/> with Idle, if
						not malicious Stories, against Peoples Lives, I did easily <lb/> perceive
						which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that <lb/> served for
						one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her <lb/> danger;
						and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she <lb/> would
						never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal <lb/> in our own
						County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for <lb/> it, and were
						put in hopes of it; but I soon saw so much, that I <orig reg="understood"
							>under- <lb/> stood </orig> thereby it was not intended, which put me
						upon consulting <lb/> the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of
						God was <orig reg="effected">ef- <lb/> fected </orig>, and she got to Road
						Island, but soon found her self not safe <lb/> when there, by reason of the
						pursuit after her; from thence she <lb/> went to New-York, along with some
						others that had escaped their <lb/> cruel hands; where we found his
						Excellency <name type="person" key="fleben">Benjamin Fletcher</name> , <lb/>
						Esq; Governour, who was very courteous to us. After this some of <lb/> my
						Goods were seized in a Friends hands, with whom I had left them, <lb/> and
						my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a <lb/> day, and
						then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners, <lb/> and their
						Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution, <lb/> no sober
						Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; <lb/> which is
						the more, considering what a People for Religion, I mean <lb/> the
						profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of <lb/> them
						Church-Members, and most of them unspotted in their <orig reg="Conversation"
							>Con- <lb/> versation </orig>, till their Adversary the Devil took up
						this Method for <lb/> accusing them. </p>

					<p> What was the reason (said <name type="person" key="bibsar">goodwife

					<p>

						<name type="person" key="corgil">Cory</name> denied it.<lb/> This was not

						Tell the truth, what was it frighted you?<lb/> I do not know any thing that
						frighted me.</p>
					<p> All the afflicted were seized now with fits, and troubled<lb/> with pinches.
						Then the court ordered his hands to be tied.<lb/> What, is it not enough to
						act witchcraft at other times,<lb/> but must you do it now in the face of
						authority?<lb/> I am a poor creature, and cannot help it.<lb/> Upon the
						motion of his head again, they had their heads<lb/> and necks afflicted.</p>
					<p> Why do you tell such wicked lies against witnesses, that<lb/> heard you
						speak after this manner, this very morning?<lb/> I never saw any thing but a
						black hog.<lb/> You said that you were stopt once in prayer; what<lb/> stopt
						you?<lb/> I cannot tell; my wife came towards me and found fault<lb/> with
						me for saying living to God and dying to sin.</p>
					<p> What was it frighted you in the barn?<lb/> I know nothing frighted me

							1692 </date> That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told
						concerning <name type="person" key="hoador">Dorcas Hoar</name> her beeing a
						fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should
						live poorely so long as her husband <name type="person" key="hoawil">willm
							Hoar</name> did live, but the said will should dye before her, &amp;
						after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of <name type="person"
							key="corens">Ens: Corning</name> &amp; his wife who should dye.first
						&amp; that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two yeares
						agoe the s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Dorcas</name> manifested to me
						great repentance for the sins of her former life &amp; that she had borrowed
						a book of Palmstry, &amp; their were rules to know what should come to pass.
						But I telling her that it was an <orig reg="evil">evill</orig> book &amp;
							<orig reg="evil">evill</orig> art shee seemed to me to renounce, or
						reject all such practices: whereupon I had great charity for her severall
						yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I discovered <pb n="398"/> an
						evillractice had been between a servant of mine &amp; some of s'd <name
							type="person" key="hoador">Hoars</name> children in conveying goods out
						of my house to the s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Hoars</name> . and I
						had a daughter <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> then between
						11 &amp; 12 years old, whome I asked if she knew of the <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Hoars</name> stealing: she told me yea, But durst not
						reveale it to me, &amp; one reason was, she was threatened that <name
							type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> was a witch &amp; had a
						book by w'ch shee could tell what s'd <name type="person" key="halreb"
							>Rebecca</name> did tell me in my house &amp; if the s'd <name
							type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> told me of the stealing, the
						said <name type="person" key="hoador">Hoar</name> would raise the <orig
							reg="devil">devill</orig> to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that
						effect. (but whether she said that <name type="person" key="hoador"
							>Dorcas</name> her selfe or her chilldren told <name type="person"
							key="halreb">Rebecca</name> those words I remember not) I asked <name
							type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> if she saw the book she said
						yea, she was shewed that book &amp; their were many streaks &amp; pictures
						in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said <name type="person" key="hoador"
							>Hoar</name> could reveale secretes &amp; work witchcrafts. I asked her
						how big the book was, she said it was like a gramer, that lay on the table.
						And said shee now I have told you of the stealing <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> will bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter
						not to think so hardly of <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name>
						. But she replyed I know <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name>
						is a witch (or to the effect) &amp; then told storys of strange things that
						had been acted in or about my house, when I &amp; my wife were abroad to
						fright s'd <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name> into silence
						about the theft, w'ch s'd <name type="person" key="halreb">Rebecca</name>
						judged to be acts of s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Hoars</name>
						witchcraft the particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the
						s'd <name type="person" key="hoador">Hoar</name> had told me of a book of
						palmstry she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be
						better satisfyed I asked <name type="person" key="tuctho">Thomas Tuck</name>
						if he knew <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody Hoar</name> to have a book
						of fortune telling &amp; he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he
						had seen w'th streaks &amp; pictures in it and that it was about the bigness
						of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this
						confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after
						my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went
						in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them
						w'ch can kill the boady &amp;c. </p>
					<p>About those times other things were spoken of the s'd <name type="person"
							key="hoador">Hoares</name> suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a
						frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for
						his consideration &amp; as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an opportunity
						to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had &amp; <name
							type="person" key="hoawil">W'm Hoar</name> answered the book was <name
							type="person" key="samjoh">John Samsons</name> &amp; his wife had
						returned the <pb n="399"/> book long agoe &amp; so the matter was left for
						that time. When discourses revived of <name type="person" key="hoador">Goody
							Hoars</name> fortune telling of later times, &amp; she beeing comited to
						Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may things that I had known &amp;
						heard of her. Shee told me that he owne fortune that she spake of, she was
						told by a shipmaster when she was first marryed. &amp; <name type="person"
							key="corens">Ens: Corning</name> fortune viz that his first wife should
						dye before him (w'ch is since come to pass) she sapke it from observing a
						certain streak under the eye of s'd <name type="person" key="corens"
							>Corning</name> or his wife: But as I take it it was his wife had the
						streak. And for seeing the <orig reg="devil">devill</orig>, or any spirit
						but ones, &amp; that was soon after old <name type="person" key="tuctho"
							>Thomas Tuck</name> dyed (w'ch I take to be about ten yeare since) &amp;
						that shee took it to be the Ghost of <name type="person" key="tuctho">Thom:
							tuck</name> coming to speak w'th her about some land s'd <name
							type="person" key="tuctho">Tuck</name> had told her of before his death.
						But that shee fled from the Ghost &amp; got away.</p>

					<p>The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch
						agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of <name
							type="person" key="samjoh">John Samsons</name> w'ch he had from her as
						she said above 20 years agoe &amp; that shee had not told fortunes since the
						time I had layed before her the <orig reg="evil">evill</orig> of it. w'ch is
						about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th <name type="person"

					<p> </p>
					<p>Because I am falsely accused. -- Your worships all of you do you think this
						is true? </p>
					<p>Nay, what do you think? </p>
					<p>I never did it. </p>
					<p>who did it? </p>
					<p>Dont ask me. </p>
					<p>Why should we not ask you? <name type="person" key="chusar">Sarah
							Churchwell</name> accuseth you, there she is. </p>
					<p>I am as innocent as the Child born to night, I have lived. 33. years here in
						Salem. </p>
					<p>What then? </p>
					<p>If you can prove that I am guilty, I will lye under it, <name type="person"
							key="chusar">Sarah </name></p>
					<p>Churchwell said last night I was afflicted at <name type="person"
							key="ingnat">Deacon Ingersolls</name> , and <name type="person"
							key="walmar">Mary Walcot</name> said it was a man with 2 staves, it was
						my master. </p>
					<p>Pray do not accuse me, I am as clear as your worships; you must do right

					<p>What book did he bring you<name type="person" key="chusar"> Sarah</name>? </p>
					<p>The same that the other woman brought. </p>
					<p>The <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> can go in any shape. </p>
					<p>Did he not [be] appear on the other side of the river and hurt you, did not
						you see him. </p>
					<p>Yes he did. </p>
					<p>Look there, she accuseth you to your face, she chargeth you that you hurt her

					<p>What would you have me say? I never wronged no man in word nor deed. </p>
					<p>Here are 3 evidences. </p>
					<p>You tax me for a wizard, you may as well tax me for a buzard I have done no

					<p>Is it no harm to afflict these? </p>
					<p>I never did it. </p>
					<p>But how comes it to be in your appearance? </p>
					<p>The Devil can taken any likeness. </p>
					<p>Not without their consent. </p>
					<p>Please your worship it is untrue, I never showed the book, I am as silly
						about these things as the child born last night. </p>
					<p>That is your Saying, you argue you have lived so long, but what then Cain
						might live long before he killed Abel, and you might live long before the

					<p>After my Humble Duty Remmbered to you, hoping in the Lord of your good

						close Confined here in a loathsome Dungeon, the Lord look down in mercy upon
						me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted
						Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized
						for the King. The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the
						Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed
						several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding
						of my own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded
						Conscience who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on
						in my Sins, but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in
						any longer, but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the
						Magistrates, who would not believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in
						here, and God knows how soon I shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me
						beg your Prayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy
						meeting in Heaven. My Mother poor Woman is very Crazey, and <pb n="491"/>

					<p>The humble declaration of <name type="person" key="jacmar">Margaret
							Jacobs</name> unto the honoured court now sitting at Salem, sheweth </p>
					<p>That whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely confined here in
						Salem goal for the crime of witchcraft, which crime thanks be to the Lord I
						am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of judgment: May
						it please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the possessed
						persons, as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination,
						which persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much startle and
						affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least measure, how
						or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else they would
						not fall down at me; they told me, if I would not confess, I should be put
						down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should
						have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart,
						to save my life; made me make the like confession I did, which confession,
						may it please the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very
						first night after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience
						that I could not sleep for fear the devil should carry me away for telling
						such horrid lies. I was, may it please the honoured court, sworn to my
						confession, as I understand since, but then, at that time, was ignorant of
						it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I trust,
						out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false forswearing
						myself. What I said, was altogether false against my grandfather, and <name
							type="person" key="bureo">Mr. Burroughs</name> , which I did to save my
						life and to have my liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience,
						made me in so much horror, that I could not contain myself before I had
						denied my confession, which I did though I saw nothing but death before <pb
							n="492"/> me, chusing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live
						in such horror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my
						confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more
						felicity in spirit, a thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement. </p>
					<p>And now, may it please your honours, your declarant, having, in part, given
						your honours a description of my condition, do leave it to your honours
						pious and judicious discretions, to take pity and compassion on my young and
						tender years, to act and do with me, as the Lord above and your honours
						shall see good, having no friend, but the Lord, to plead my cause for me;
						not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft, nor any
						other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant
						shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for your honours happiness in
						this life and eternal felicity in the world to come. So prays your honours
						declarant. </p>

					<p>Your Petitioner who knows well the Condition of her poor Daughter, together

					<p>Christianity &amp; Nature do each of them oblige Your Petitioner to be very

						as she has offer'd this her addresse on behalf of her daughter: </p>

						and troubles (next to supplicating to a Good &amp; Mercifull God) Your

						conscience without a free confession. A. If I knew any thing more, I would
						speak it to the utmost. -- Goody Lacey, the daughter, called in, began thus;
						Oh! mother! how do you do? We have left Christ, and the devil hath gat hold

						her? Look upon her in a friendly way. -- She, trying so to do, struck her

					<p>Here are these 2 grown persons now accuse you, w't say you? Do not you see

					<p>The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am an innocent person </p>
					<p>It is very awfull to all to see these agonies &amp; you an old Professor thus

					<p>I am as clear as the child unborn </p>
					<p>What uncertainty there may be in apparitions I know not, yet this with me

					<p>No, I have none but with God alone. </p>

					<p> </p>

						black man whispering in your ear, &amp; birds about you what do you say to
						it </p>
					<p>It is all false I am clear </p>
					<p>Possibly you may apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led aside
						by temptations that way </p>
					<p>I have not </p>
					<p>What a sad thing it is that a church member here &amp; now an other of Salem,

					<p>
						<name type="person" key="popmis">Mrs Pope</name> fell into a grevious fit,

					<p>They accuse you of hurting them, &amp; if you think it is not unwillingly but

					<p>I cannot tell what to think of it </p>
					<p>Afterwards when this was som what insisted on she said I do not think so: she

					<p>Well then give an answer now, do you think these suffer against their wills

					<p>I do not think these suffer against their wills </p>
					<p>Why did you never visit these afflicted persons </p>

					<p>Is it not an unaccountable case that when you are examined these persons are

						their dissatisfaction of the <pb n="608"/> Verdict, several of the Jury
						declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon the honoured

						how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a further
						opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and then going
						into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court were

							Osgood</name> , wife of <name type="person" key="osgjoh">Captain

							>John Hawthorne </name> and other their Majesties justices. </p>
					<p>She confesses, that about 11 years ago, when she was in a melancholy state
						and condition, she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain
						time, she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of the house, which yet
						she thought was a real cat. However, at that time, it diverted her from
						praying to God, and instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which
						time she made a covenant with the devil, who, as a black man, came to her
						and presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger and that left a red
						spot: And that upon her signing, the devil told her he was her God, and that
						she should serve and worship him, and, she believes, she consented to it.
						She says further, that about two years agone, she was carried through the
						air, in company with <name type="person" key="fryeun">deacon Frye's
							wife</name> , <name type="person" key="bakebe">Ebenezer Baker's
							wife</name> , and <name type="person" key="sprmar">Goody Tyler</name> ,
						to five mile pond, where she was baptized by the devil, who dipped her face
						in the water and made her renounce her former baptism, and told her she must
						be his, soul and body, forever, and that she must serve him, which she
						promised to do. She says, the renouncing her first baptism was after her
						dipping, and that she was transported back again through the air, in company
						with the forenamed persons, in the same manner as she went, and believes
						they were carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the pole? A. As
						I said before, viz. four persons and no more but whom she had named above.
						-- She confesses she has afflicted three persons, <name type="person"
							key="sawjoh">John Sawdy</name> , <name type="person" key="sprmar">Martha
							Sprague</name> and <name type="person" key="fosros">Rose Foster</name> ,
						and that she did it by pinching her bed clothes, and giving consent the
						devil should do it in her shape, and that the devil could not do it without
						her consent. -- She confesses the afflicting persons in the court, by the
						glance of her eye. She says, as she was coming down to Salem to be <pb
							n="616"/> examined, she and the rest of the company with her, stopped at
						Mr. Phillips's <!-- Comment: --> to refresh themselves, and the afflicted
						persons, being behind them upon the road, came up just as she was mounting
						again and were then afflicted, and cried out upon her, so that she was
						forced to stay until they were all past, and said she only looked that way
						towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape of an innocent
						person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this way of
						witchcraft? A. Satan, and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction and
						quietness in her future state, but never performed any thing; and that she
						has lived more miserably and more discontented since, than ever before. She
						confesses further, that she herself, in company with <name type="person"
							key="pareli">Goody Parker</name> , <name type="person" key="sprmar"
							>Goody Tyler</name> , and Goody Dean <!-- Comment: --> , had a meeting
						at <name type="person" key="tylmos">Moses Tyler's</name> house, last monday
						night, to afflict, and that she and Goody Dean <!-- Comment: --> carried the
						shape of Mr. Dean, <!-- Comment: --> the minister, between them, to make
						persons believe that Mr. Dean <!-- Comment: --> afflicted. Q. What hindered
						you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not suffer it so
						to be, that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. Have
						you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof, as I shall
						answer in the presence of God and his people; but said, that the black man
						stood before her, and told her, that what she had confessed was a lie;
						notwithstanding, she said that what she had confessed was true, and thereto
						put her hand. Her husband being present was asked, if he judged his wife to
						be any way discomposed. He answered, that having lived with her so long, he
						doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed, but has cause to believe what
						she has said is true. -- When <name type="person" key="osgmar">Mistress
							Osgood</name> was first called, she afflicted <name type="person"
							key="sprmar">Martha Sprague</name> and <name type="person" key="fosros"
							>Rose Foster</name> , by the glance of her eyes, and recovered them out

						had her last child) she had a fit of sickness, and was melancholy; and so
						thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and
						accordingly did prefix the said time. Being asked about the cat, in the
						shape of which she had confessed that the Devil had appeared to her,
						&amp;c., she replied, that, being told that the Devil had appeared to her,
						and must needs appear to her, &amp;c. (she being a witch), she at length did
						own that the Devil had appeared to her; and, being pressed to say in what
						creature's shape he appeared, she at length did say that it was in the shape
						of a cat. Remembering that, some time before her being apprehended, as she
						went out at her door, she saw a cat, &amp;c.; not as though she any whit
						suspected the said cat to be the Devil, in the day of it, but because some
						creature she must mention, and this came into her mind at that time. </p>

					</opener>
					<p>We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long
						under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that
						great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it
						our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them
						will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to
						speak something at present are <name type="person" key="osgmar">Mrs. Mary
							Osgood</name> , <name type="person" key="fryeun">Eunice Frye</name> ,
							<name type="person" key="dandel">Deliverance Dane</name> , <name
							type="person" key="wilsar">Sarah Wilson</name> and <name type="person"
							key="barabi">Abigail Barker</name> , who are women of whom we can truly
						give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us
						so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to
						suspect them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary
						conversation have obtained a good report in the place, where they have been
						well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members. </p>
					<p>We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were
						accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent
						were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were
						accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and
						others, tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have
						thought any evil of them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of
						that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people, took
						great pains to persuade them to own what they were, by the afflicted,
						charged with, and, indeed, did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves
						guilty, as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good
						women did very much assert their innocency, yet some of them said they were
						not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them, because there was
						that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain
						indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they seriously professed they
						knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, by the unwearied
						sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both <pb n="619"/> at
						home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they
						were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and
						believe they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event
						might be, and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that
						confessing was the only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a
						temptation for timorous women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction
						that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves
						proceeded from conviction of the fact, we should have had nothing to have
						said for them, but we are induced to think that it did not, because they did
						soon privately retract what they had said, as we are informed, and, while
						they were in prison, they declared to such as they had confidence to speak
						freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what they had owned, and
						that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden
						they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful
						for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, considering
						the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us, and
						what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, we
						cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that
						hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under
						the like circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of
						them that while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such
						persons as, of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do
						we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of
						that evil that they are now charged with. </p>

					<p>the humble Petition of <name type="person" key="parjoh">John Parker,</name>
						&amp; <name type="person" key="parjos">Joseph Parker </name> of Andover
						sheweth, </p>
					<p>That whereas our mother <name type="person" key="parmar">mary Parker</name>
						of Andover, was apprehended upon suspition of witchcraft, and being brought
						to a tryall at Salem Court, was condemned: since her death the sherriff of
						Essex sent an officer to seise on her estate. The said officer required us
						in their majestyes name to give him an Account of our mothers estate,
						pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told him that our mother left no
						estate; (which we are able to make appear) notwithstanding which, he seised
						upon our cattell, Corn &amp; hay, to a considerable value; and ordered us to
						go down to Salem and make an agreement with the sherrife, otherwise the
						estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing what advantage the Law might
						give him against us, and fearing we should sustain greater Damage by the
						loss of our Estate, went to the sherriff accordingly, who told us he might
						take away all that was seised. if he pleased, but was willing to do us a
						kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded ten
						pounds of us, but at length was willing to take Six pounds, which he has <pb
							n="637"/> obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our
						Mother had left any Estate, we know not of any Law in force in this
						Province, by which it should be forfeited upon her condemnation; much less
						can we understand that there is any Justice or reason, for the sherriff to
						seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our own act has obliged us to pay
						him a Summ of money, yet we declare that we were drawn to it partly by the
						officers great pretences of Law for what he did, partly to prevent the loss
						of our estate which we feard would be immediately sold. </p>
					<p>How we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case, and if it be
						judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us, upon the
						forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that
						obligation, which the sherriff, taking advantage of our ignorance hath
						brough us under And yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray &amp;c

						-- Q. <name type="person" key="proeli">Elizabeth Procter</name> ! you

						other fits. Q. What do you say <name type="person" key="proeli">Goody
							Procter</name> to these things? A. I take God in heaven to be my
						witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child unborn. Q. <name
							type="person" key="putann2">Ann Putman!</name> doth this woman hurt you.
						A. Yes Sir, a great many times. -- Then the accused looked upon them and
						they fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A.
						Yes, Sir, often, and saith she hath made her maid set her hand to it. Q.
							<name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail Williams!</name> does this
						woman hurt you? A. Yes, Sir, often. Q. Does she bring the book to you? A.

						well. -- Did not you, said Abigal, tell me, that your maid had written?

						By and by, both of them cried out of <name type="person" key="projoh"
							>Goodman Procter</name> himself, and said he was a wizard. --
						Immediately, many, if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. -- Q. Ann
						Putman! who hurt you? A. <name type="person" key="projoh">Goodman
							Procter</name> and his wife too. -- Afterwards some of the afflicted
						cried, there is <name type="person" key="projoh">Procter</name> going to
						take up <name type="person" key="popmis">Mrs. Pope's</name> feet. -- And her
						feet were immediately taken up. -- Q. What do you say <name type="person"

						to <name type="person" key="popmis">Mrs. Pope</name> , and immediately, said

						is bringing you out. -- <name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail

						Immediately <name type="person" key="wilabi">Abigail</name> cried out, her

					<p>The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and
						Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, having
						Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged
						against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable
						Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be
						possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will
						be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates,
						Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and
						incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no
						other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent
						Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be
						Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament,
						since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of
						the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till
						they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their
						Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of
						making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a
							<pb n="690"/> Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their
						Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son
							<name type="person" key="prowil">William Procter</name> , when he was
						examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was
						Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his
						Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the
						rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions
						are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our
						Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods.
						If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg
						that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in
						their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if
						not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of
						saving the sheeding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord
						in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants, </p>

					<p>After many questiones and negative answers returned and her Stricking Down of
						severall of the afflicted persons with her looks, she was Desyred to tell
						the truth in this matter She then said that this May last she was under
						great Discontentednes &amp; troubled w'h feare about the Indians,
						&amp; used often to dream of fighting with them. Being asked what was
						the Devils temptation under her discontent[mbar ]t she said she would
						confess if she could But that there was something at her breast that
						hindered her. she said she had often prayed but thought she was the worse
						for praying and knows not but that the Devil has tempted her not to pray,
						for her breath has been often Stopt as it was just now; Being asked if the
						Devil did not Desier her to renounce her baptisme, she answered that she had
						thoughts she was rather the worse for her baptisme and has wished she had
						not been baptised because she had not improved it as she ought to have done
						she saith she used to get into a corner alone and Desryed to prey but her
						mouth would be Stopt but sometymes she had been helped to say Lord be merce
						full to me a sinner. Being again asked how far she had yeilded to Satan she
						said the Devil promised her she should not be discovered and if she was
						discovered &amp; brought down that she should goe home Innocent
						&amp; cleare but now find he has deluded her. Being again asked how long
						it is since saten furst wrought with her in this manner she said she could
						not well tell how long but thinks it is not two years. And confesses that
						she went In her Spirit <name type="person" key="swatim">[to Timo'
						Swans]</name> and did often think of him &amp; <pb n="768"/> her hands
						would be clinched, and that she would grip the dishclout or anything else
						and so think of the person; And by this &amp; afflicting of others since
						She came down she is convinced she is a witch -- she saith now, the Devil
						appeared to her in the shape of a Tawny man and promised to keep her from
						the Indians and she should have happy dayes with her sone -- she was asked
						if she did not signe the <orig reg="Devil's book">Devills book</orig>;
						answered he brought something which she [took] to bee a piece of burch bark
						and she made a mark with her finger by rubbing off the whit Scurff. And he
						promised if she would serve him she should be safe from the Indians (she was
						then a litle stopt again &amp; believed it was the Devil that did it)//
						Being asked if the Devil did not say she was to serve him Answered Yes, and
						signed the mark upon that condition and was to praise him w'h her whole
						heart, and twas to that appearance she prayed at all tymes for he said he
						was able to delyver her from the Indians And it was the feare of the Indians
						that put her upon it. she confesses she hurt <name type="person" key="swatim">Timothy Swan</name> and thinks she was twice at salem
						Village witch meeting and that <name type="person" key="brisar">Goody
							Bridges</name> was one of her company -- she said as she came along in
						order to examination she promised herself twenty tymes by the way (but
						[seald] it was to the Devil) That if she should Dye upon the Gallowse yet
						she would not say any thing but that she was Innocent. &amp; rejoyced In
						the thought of it that She Should goe home Inocent -- she saith that <name type="person" key="gremar">Goody Green</name> and <name type="person" key="brohan1">Goody Broomage</name> were also her companions and that
							<name type="person" key="brohan1">Broomage</name> afflicted <name type="person" key="swatim">Swan</name> by squeezing his arms, And is
						afrayd that she the s'd <name type="person" key="toomar">Toothaker</name>
						squeezed his throat -- she said further that when <name type="person" key="brisar">Goody Bridges</name> (who had confessed before) urged her
						also to confess she had then no remembrance of this but with the justices
						Discourse and the help of god it came into her mind. she saith she thought
						that that appearance was God her creator &amp; being asked if she did
						not know otherwise answered The Devil is so subtel that when she would
						confess he stops her and deludes also by scripture and being asked what
						scripture he made inser of to her she mentioned that in the Psalmes where it
						is said Let my enemies be confounded, And so she had wished them all
						Destroyed that raised such reports of her she confesses that her sister was
						with her at all the meetings &amp; particularly at Salem Village
						&amp; there went with her <name type="person" key="brisar">Goody Bridges</name>

						the table before her. She sayes further there was a minister a litle man
						whose name is <name type="person" key="burgeo">Burroughs</name> that
						preached at the Village meeting of witches, and she heard that they used
						read &amp; write at these meetings And, that they did talk of 305
						witches in the country. she saith their discourse was about the pulling down
						the Kingdom of Christ and setting up the Kingdom of satan, and also Knew
							<name type="person" key="howeli">Goody How</name> emong the rest. Being
						asked if there was not a woman that stirred them up to afflict <name type="person" key="swatim">Swan</name> Answered yes there was a pretty
						[Elderly] woman that was most busie about him and encouraged the rest to
						afflict him. she thinks she set her hand to that book at Salem Village
						meeting. And thinks the [End] of all their setting their hand to that book
						was to come in, and afflict &amp; set up the Devils Kingdome. she being
						asked if her husband did not speak to his daughter to Kill one Button a
						reputed witch answered yes, and that they used to read many historyes,
						especially one book that treated of the 12 signes, from which book they
						could tell a great Deale. -- she saith she never knew her daughter to be in
						this condition before this summer, But that she was at Salem Village meeting
						once with her, she cannot tell that her daughter did then signe the book but
						a great many did. Being asked how many were of her Society she said <name type="person" key="brohan1">Goody Broomage</name> , <name type="person" key="fosros">foster</name> , <name type="person" key="gremar">green</name> , the two <name type="person" key="lacmar2">

					<p>Goodwife <name type="person" key="tylmar">Tyler </name> did say, that, when
						she was first apprehended, she had no fears upon her, and did think that
						nothing could have made her confess against herself. But since, she had
						found, to her great grief, that she had wronged the truth, and falsely
						accused herself. She said that, when she was brought to Salem, her brother
							<name type="person" key="brijoh">Bridges</name> rode with her; and that,
						all along the way from Andover to Salem, her brother kept telling her that
						she must needs be a witch, since the afflicted accused her, and at her touch
						were raised out of their fits, and urging her to confess herself a witch.
						She as constantly told him that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of
						witchcraft, and begged him not to urge her to confess. However, when she
						came to Salem, she was carried to a room, where her brother on one side, and
							<name type="person" key="emejoh">Mr. John Emerson</name> on the other
						side, did tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the
						Devil before her eyes at that time (and, accordingly, the said <name type="person" key="emejoh">Emerson</name> would attempt with his hand to
						beat him away from her eyes); and they so urged her to confess, that she
						wished herself in any dungeon, rather than be so treated. <name type="person" key="emejoh">Mr. Emerson</name> told her, once and again,
						`Well, I see you will not confess! Well, I will now leave you; and then you
						are undone, body and soul, for ever.' Her brother urged her to confess, and
						told her that, in so doing, she could not lie: to which she answered, `Good
						brother, do not say so; for I shall lie if I confess, and then who shall
						answer unto God for my lie?' He still asserted it, and said that God would
						not suffer so many good men to be in such an error about it, and that she
						would be hanged if she did not confess; and continued so long and so
						violently to urge and press her to confess, that she thought, verily, that
						her life would have gone from her, and became so terrified in her mind that
						she <pb n="778"/> owned, at length, almost any thing that they propounded to
						her; that she had wronged her conscience in so doing; she was guilty of a
						great sin in belying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long as she
						lived. This she said, and a great deal more of the like nature; and all with
						such affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it exceeds
						any pen to describe and express the same. </p>

					<p>The Deposition of <name type="person" key="wilbra">Bray Wilkins</name> of

						charged with Witchcraft when he was at first complained of by the afflicted
						persons for afflicting of them he came to my house greatly troubled,
						desiring me with some other Neighbours to pray for him I told him I was then
						going from home, &amp; could not stay, but if I could come home before
						night I should not be unwilling, but it was near night before I came home
						&amp; so I did not answere his desire, but I heard no more of him upon
						that account. Whither my not answering his desire did not offend him, I
						cannot tell, but I was jealous afterwards that it did. A little after my
						wife &amp; I went to Boston at the last Election, when I was as well in
						health as in many yeares before, &amp; the Election day coming to my
						brother Lft <name type="person" key="wayric">Richard Way's </name> house, at

							<name type="person" key="lawsmr">Mr Lawson </name> &amp; his wife

						after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any, I did but step
						into the next room, &amp; I was presently taken in a strange condition,
						so that I could not dine, nor eat any thing, I cannot express the misery I
						was in for my water was sodainly stopt, &amp; I had no benefit of
						nature, but was like a man on a Rack, &amp; I told my wife immediately
						that I was afraid that <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">Willard </name> had
						done me wrong, my pain continuing &amp; finding no relief my jealousie
						continued: <name type="person" key="lawsmr">Mr Lawson, </name> &amp;
						others there, were all amazed, &amp; knew not what to do for me: There
						was a Woman accounted <pb n="848"/> skilfull came hoping to help me,
						&amp; after she had used means, she askt me whither none of those evil
						persons had done me damage. I said, I could not say they had, but I was sore
						afraid they had, she answered she did fear so too, as near as I remember. I
						lay in this case. 3. or. 4. dayes at Boston, &amp; afterwards with the
						jeopardy of my life (as I thought) I came home, &amp; then some of my
						friends coming to see me (&amp; at this time <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">John Willard </name> was run away) one of the afflicted
						persons <name type="person" key="lewmer">Mercy Lewes</name> came in with
						them, &amp; they askt whither she saw any thing: she said yes, they are
						looking for <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">John Willard </name> but there
						he is upon his Grandfathers Belly (&amp; at that time I was in grevious
						pain in the small of my Belly) I continued so in greivous pain &amp; my
						water much stopt till s'd <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">Willard </name>
						was in chains, &amp; then as near as I can guess I had considerable
						ease, but on the other hand in the room of a stoppage, I was vexed with a
						flowing of water, so that it was hard to keep my self dry. On the. 5. July
						last talking with some friends about <name type="person" key="wiljoh4">John
							Willard </name> some pleading his innocency &amp; my self &amp;
						some others arguing the contrary, within about 1/4 of an hour after that I

						the jury concerning the Murder of my Grandson <name type="person" key="wildan">Dan: Wilkins</name> that would take away his life if any

						<head>(Letter No. 1) </head>
						<p>When I first arrived I found this Province miserably harrassed with a
							most Horrible witchcraft or Possession of <orig reg="Devils">Devills</orig> which had broke in upon severall Townes, some scores of
							poor people were taken with preternaturall torments some scalded with
							brimstone some had pins stuck in their flesh others hurried into the
							fire and water and some dragged out of their houses and carried over the
							tops of trees and hills for many Miles together; it hath been
							represented to mee much like that of Sweden about thirty years agoe, and
							there were many committed to prison upon suspicion of Witchcraft before
							my arrivall. The loud cries and clamours of the friends of the afflicted
							people with the advice of the Deputy Governor and many others prevailed
							with mee to give a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering what
							witchcraft might be at the bottome or whether it were not a possession.
							The chief Judge in this Commission was the Deputy Governour and the rest
							were persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched
							upon. When the Court came to sitt at Salem in the County of Essex they
							convicted more than twenty persons of being guilty of witchcraft, some
							of the convicted were such as confessed their Guilt, the Court as I
							understand began their proceedings with the accusations of the afflicted
							and then went upon other humane evidences to strengthen that. I was
							almost the whole time of the proceeding abroad in the service of Their
							Majesties in the Eastern part of the County and depended upon the
							Judgment of the Court as to a right method of proceeding in cases of
							Witchcraft but when I came home I found many persons in a strange
							ferment of dissatisfaction which was increased by some hott Spiritts
							that blew up the flame, but on enquiring into the matter I found that
							the <pb n="862"/>
							<orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> had taken upon him the name and shape of
							severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain knowledge
							of good reputation for which cause I have now forbidden the committing
							of any more that shall be accused without unavoydable necessity, and
							those that have been committed I would shelter from any Proceedings
							against them wherein there may be the least suspition of any wrong to be
							done unto the Innocent. I would also wait for any particular directions
							or commands if their Majesties please to give mee any for the fuller
							ordering this perplexed affair. I have also put a stop to the printing
							of any discourses one way or other, that may increase the needless
							disputes of people upon this occasion, because I saw a likelyhood of
							kindling an inextinguishable flame if I should admitt any publique and
							open Contests and I have grieved to see that some who should have done
							their Majesties and this Province better service have so far taken
							Councill of Passion as to desire the precipitancy of these matters,
							these things have been improved by some to give me many interuptions in
							their Majesties service and in truth none of my vexations have been
							greater than this, than that their majesties service has been hereby
							unhappily clogged, and the Persons who have made soe ill improvement of
							these matters here are seeking to turne it all upon mee, but I hereby
							declare that as soon as I came from fighting against their Majesties
							Enemyes and understood what danger some of their innocent subjects might
							be exposed to, if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did
							prevaile either to the committing or trying any of them, I did before
							any application was made unto me about it put a stop to the proceedings
							of the Court and they are now stopt till their Majesties pleasure be
							known. Sir I beg pardon for giving you all this trouble, the reason is
							because I know my enemies are seeking to turn it all upon me and I take
							this liberty because I depend upon your friendship, and desire you will
							please to give a true understanding of the matter if any thing of this
							kind be urged or made use of against mee. Because the justnesse of my
							proceeding herein will bee a sufficient defence. Sir </p>

						<p>By the Capn. of the Samuell and Henry <!-- Comment: --> I gave an account
							that att my arrival here I found the Prisons full of people committed
							upon suspition of witchcraft and that continuall complaints were made to
							me that many persons were grievously tormented by witches and that they
							cryed out upon severall persons by name, as the cause of their torments.
							The number of these complaints increasing every day, by advice of the
							Lieut Govr. and the Councill I gave a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to
							try the suspected witches and at that time the generality of the people
							represented to me as reall witchcraft and gave very strange instances of
							the same. The first in Commission was the Lieut. Govr. and the rest
							persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon
							and I depended upon the Court for a right method of proceeding in cases
							of witchcraft. At that time I went to command the army at the Eastern
							part of the Province, for the French and Indians had made an attack upon
							some of our Fronteer Towns. I continued there for some time but when I
							returned I <pb n="864"/> found people much disatisfied at the
							proceedings of the Court, for about Twenty persons were condemned and
							executed of which number some were thought by many persons to be
							innocent. The Court still proceeded in the same method of trying them,
							which was by the evidence of the afflicted persons who when they were
							brought into the Court as soon as the suspected witches looked upon them
							instantly fell to the ground in strange agonies and grievous torments,
							but when touched by them upon the arme or some other part of their flesh
							they immediately revived and came to themselves, upon [which] they made
							oath that the Prisoner at the Bar did afflict them and that they saw
							their shape or <orig reg="specter">spectre</orig> come from their bodies
							which put them to such paines and torments: When I enquired into the
							matter I was enformed by the Judges that they begun with this, but had
							humane testimony against such as were condemned and undoubted proof of
							their being witches, but at length I found that the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> did take upon him the shape of Innocent persons and
							some were accused of whose innocency I was well assured and many
							considerable persons of unblameable life and conversation were cried out
							upon as witches and wizards. The Deputy Govr. notwithstanding persisted
							vigorously in the same method, to the great disatisfaction and
							disturbance of the people, untill I put an end to the Court and stopped
							the proceedings, which I did because I saw many innocent persons might
							otherwise perish and at that time I thought it my duty to give an
							account thereof that their Ma'ties pleasure might be signifyed, hoping
							that for the better ordering thereof the Judges learned in the law in
							England might give such rules and directions as have been practized in
							England for proceedings in so difficult and so nice a point; When I put
							an end to the Court there ware at least fifty persons in prison in great
							misery by reason of the extream cold and their poverty, most of them
							having only <orig reg="specter">spectre</orig> evidence against them,
							and their mittimusses being defective, I caused some of them to be lett
							out upon bayle and put the Judges upon considering of a way to reliefe
							others and prevent them from perishing in prison, upon which some of
							them were convinced and acknowledged that their former proceedings were
							too violent and not grounded upon a right foundation but that if they
							might sit againe, they would proceed after another method, and whereas
								<name type="person" key="matinc">Mr. Increase Mathew</name> and
							severall other Divines did give it as their Judgment that the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> might afflict in the shape of an innocent
							person and that the look and touch of the suspected persons was not
							sufficient proofe against them, these things had not the same stress
							layd upon them as before, and upon <pb n="865"/> this consideration I
							permitted a spetiall Superior Court to be held at Salem in the County of
							Essex on the third day of January, the Lieut Govr. being Chief Judge.
							Their method of proceeding being altered, all that were brought to
							tryall to the number of fifety two, were cleared saving three, and I was
							enformed by the Kings Attorny Generall that some of the cleared and the
							condemned were under the same circumstances or that there was the same
							reason to clear the three condemned as the rest according to his
							Judgment. The Deputy Govr. signed a Warrant for their speedy execution
							and also of five others who were condemned at the former Court of Oyer
							and terminer, but considering how the matter had been managed I sent a
							reprieve whereby the execucion was stopped untill their Maj. pleasure be
							signified and declared. The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was inraged
							and filled with passionate anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a
							Superior Court then held at Charles Towne, and indeed hath from the
							beginning hurried on these matters with great precipitancy and by his
							warrant hath caused the estates, goods and chattles of the executed to
							be seized and disposed of without my knowledge or consent. The stop put
							to the first method of proceedings hath dissipated the blak cloud that
							threatened this Province with destruccion; for whereas this delusion of
							the <orig reg="Devil">Devill</orig> did spread and its dismall effects
							touched the lives and estates of many of their Ma'ties Subjects and the
							reputation of some of the principall persons here, and indeed unhappily
							clogged and interrupted their Ma'ties affaires which hath been a great
							vexation to me, I have no new complaints but peoples minds before
							divided and distracted by differing opinions concerning this matter are
							now well composed. </p>

							heartily desire that this place, and the whole land, may be purged from
							that great wickedness: yet if any of our #[freinds] friends and
							neighbours have been misrepresented, as tis possible some of them have
							been; wee would crave leave (if it might be without offence) to speak
							something in their behalf, haveing no other desighn therein, then that
							the truth may appear. We can truly give this Testimony of the most of
							them belonging to this Town, that have been accused, that they never
							gave the least occasion (as we hear of) to their neerest relations or
							most intimate acquaintance, to suspect them of witchcraft. Severall of
							the women that are accused were members of this church in full
							Communion, and had obtained a good report, for their blameless
							conversation, and their walking as becometh woemen professing godliness.
							But whereas it may be alledged, that the most of our people that have
							been apprehended for witchcraft, have upon Examination confessed it. To
							which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for those that freely and
							upon conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend the case of some
							of them to be otherwise. for from the information we have had and the
							discourse some of us have had with the prisoners, we have reason to
							think that the extream urgency that was used with some of them by their
							friends and others who privately examined them, and the fear they were
							then under, hath been an inducement to them to own such things, as we
							cannott since find thay are conscious of; and the truth of what we now
							declare, we judge will in time more plainly appear. And some of them
							have exprest to their neighbours that it hath been their great trouble,
							that they have wronged themselves and the truth in their confessions. </p>
						<p>We are also very sensible of the disstressed condition of severall poor
							familyes, on whom this great trouble is fallen; some #[more] of our
							neighbors are like to be impoverished &amp; ruin'd by the great
							charge they are at to maintain such of their familyes as are in Prison,
							and by the fees that are demanded of them, whose case we pray may be
							considered. </p>
						<p>Our troubles which hitherto have been great, we foresee are like to
							continue and increase, if other methods be not taken then as yet have
							been, for there are more of our neighb'rs of good reputation &amp;
							approved integrity, who are still accused, and complaints have been made
							against them, And we know not who can think himself safe, if the
							Accusations of children and others who are under a Diabolicall influence
							shall be received against persons of good fame. </p>
						<pb n="878"/>
						<p> </p>
						<p>We thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good creditt
							among our selves, but some Honorable &amp; worthy men of other
							places, do suffer in their names by the acusations of afflicted people
							in this Town </p>
						<p>Thus haveing given your Honors some account of our present troubles, we
							crave pardon for our boldness in this Address, and humbly pray this
							Honored Court to take into their serious consideration our low and
							distressed estate: And that the only wise God may bless yo'r counsels
							&amp; Endeavors for the welfare of his people, shall be the prayer

							had the understanding of anything amongst us. Therefore doe declare,
							that I beleeve the reports have been Scandalous, and unjust, neither
							will bear the light, As for that, of the Sive, and Cisers I never heard
							of it, till this last Summer, and the Sabboth after I spake publiqly
							concerning it since which I beleeve it hath not been tryed, <pb n="882"/> As for such things of Charmes, and ways to find their cattle, I never
							heard, nor doe I know any Neighbour that ever did so, neither have I any
							grounds to beleeve it. I have lived above Fortie fower yeares in the
							Towne, and have been frequent among the Inhabitants, and should
							certainely heard if so it had been. That there was a suspicion of
							Goodwife Carrier<!-- Comment: --> among some of us before she was

							them, and had Charity been put on, the <orig reg="Devil">Divel</orig>

							Innocent persons have been accused, &amp; Imprisoned, the Conceit of
								<orig reg="Specter">Spectre</orig> Evidence as an infallible mark
							did too far prevaile with us Hence we so easily parted with our
							neighbours of honest, &amp; good report, &amp; members in full

							knew nothing in their lives, nor any of our neighbours to suspect them
							and thus things were hurried on, hence such strange breaches in

							sobrietie, professing their innocency, though through the Devils
							subtilty they were too much urged to Confesse, and we thought we did doe
							well in so doeing, yet they stood their ground professing they knew

						<p>This hath been a trouble to me, considering how oft it hath been sayd you

						<p>The Address of severall Ministers of the County of Essex. </p>
						<p>Whereas in the year 1692 some of our neighbours of a good conversation,
							were apprehended and imprisoned upon suspition of Witchcraft, upon the
							complaint of some young persons under Diabolicall molestations; and upon
							their Tryall at the Court at Salem were condemned; great weight being
							layd upon the evidence of the Afflicted persons, their Accusers Sentence
							of Death was Executed on severall of them, others were Reprieved. But
							since it is apparent and hath been Acknowledged, that there were Errors
							and mistakes in the aforesaid Tryalls; and notwithstanding the care and
							conscientious endeavour of the Honorable Judges to do the thing that is
							right: yet there is great reason to fear that Innocent persons then
							suffered, and that God may have a controversy with the Land upon that
							account. </p>
						<p>We would therefore humbly propose to the consideration of this Honored
							Court, whether something may not, and ought not, to be publickly done to
							clear the good name and reputation of some who have suffered as
							aforesaid, against whom there was not as is supposed sufficient evidence
							to prove the guilt of such a crime and for whom there are good grounds
							of charity. Some of the condemned persons aforesaid, and others in
							behalf of their Relations who have suffered, have lately Petitioned this
							Honoured Court upon this Account. We pray that their case may be duely
							considered. </p>

							1692, by some called witchcraft, first breaking forth at <name type="person" key="parsam">Mr. Parris's</name> house, several young
							persons, being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for

							that, if a person was sick, the afflicted person could tell what or who
							was the cause of that sickness: <name type="person" key="baljos">Joseph
								Ballard</name> , of Andover, his wife being sick at the same time,
							he, either from himself or by the advice of others, fetched two of the
							persons, called the afflicted persons, from Salem village to Andover,
							which was the beginning of that dreadful calamity that befel us in
							Andover, believing the said accusations to be true, sent for the said
							persons to come together to the meeting house in Andover, the afflicted
							persons being there. After <name type="person" key="bartho1">Mr.
							Barnard</name> had been at prayer, we were blindfolded, and our hands
							were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their fits and
							falling into their fits at our coming into their presence, as they said;
							and some led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they
							were well, and that we were guilty of afflicting them: Whereupon, we
							were all seized, as prisoners, by a warrant from the Justice of the
							peace and forthwith carried to Salem. And, by reason of that sudden
							surprizal, we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime, we
							were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated and
							affrighted even out of our reason. and our nearest and dearest
							relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great
							danger, apprehended there was no other way to save our lives, as the
							case was then circumstanced, but by our confessing ourselves to be such
							and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be, they, out of
							tenderness and pity, persuaded us to confess what we did confess. And
							indeed that confession, that it is said we made, was no other than what
							was suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we were
							witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it
							was so; and our understandings, our reason, our faculties, almost gone,
							we were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the hard
							measures they used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence,
							but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and most of what
							we said, was but, in effect, a consenting to what they said. Some time
							after, when we were better composed, they <pb n="972"/> telling us what
							we had confessed, we did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of
							such things; and we hearing that <name type="person" key="warsam">Samuel

							thinke he was guilty of I say besides that reproach &amp; the grief
							&amp; sorrow I was exposed to by that means I do account our dammage
							as to our outward estate to have been very considerable. for by reason
							of my said former Husband being seized by order of the civil Authority
							&amp; imprisoned all our Husbands concerns were laid by for that
							summer we had not opportunity to plant or sow whereas we were wont to
							raise our own bread corn I Reckon (which your Honors may please more
							certainly to Inform your selves from the Records of those unhappy times
							&amp; things that happened) I say according to my best Remembranc
							from the time of his first imprisonment to the time of his suffering was
							near upon half a year all which time I was at the trouble &amp;
							charge to provide for him in prison what he stood in need of out of our
							own estate, my aforesaid Husband was 3 weeks a prisoner at Boston which
							occasioned me to be at yet more charge &amp; trouble &amp; altho

							appointed I was forced to hire a horse at Salem &amp; go to Boston
							to see what was the reason of the failure, I have nothing further to add
